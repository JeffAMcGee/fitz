These are known bugs in Fitz.  Most of them will be fixed eventually. There are
also unknown bugs, which probably won't be fixed until someone like you finds
them and tells me about it or fixes it themselves.

/*=== Scribbling on Other Applications =======================================*/
Fitz assumes that the top-right corner is empty. If an application actually puts
something there, Fitz will cover it up, which will look bad and may hurt
functionality.

applications that use their top-right corner:
gimp - All sorts of stuff (I currently switch decorations to use the gimp)
firefox - the about firefox button
konsole - some programs (including lynx) use that corner of the console if the
		menu is off
old-school X programs that put the help menu on the right side

Dialog titlebars will fix some of this.

/*=== Configuration Change Causes show() on All Desktops =====================*/
Normally when Fitz starts, kwin calls show() for each of the windows on the
current desktop; however, when Fitz is started after changing the decoration or
settings from KControl, kwin calls show for every window -- including windows
on other virtual desktops.  As a result, Fitz draws bars when it should not.
To avoid this, I maximize every application window when starting up.
Eventually the maximizing should be optional.

/*=== Lower Without Paint Event ==============================================*/
Assume you have the following two windows: ( \VX is the Fitz::Bar at the top
right corner)

+-Konsole <2>-----+
|              \VX|
| +-Konsole-+     |
| |      \VX|     |
| |         |     |
| +---------+     |
|                 |
+-----------------+

If you middle click on a border of the smaller window to lower it or if you set
"Focus Follows Mouse" in Window Behavior, set autoraise with a delay, and then
hover the mouse over the larger window, you will get something like this:

+-Konsole <2>-----+
|              \VX|
|                 |
|        \VX      |
|                 |
|                 |
|                 |
+-----------------+

The Fitz::Bar of the smaller window does not go away because this does not
generate a paint event or any other call to any of the KDecoration virtual
functions.  Fixing this will probably require a change in kwin like a new signal
zorderChange() or two signals: lower() and raise().

/*=== Title Bar Doubleclick ==================================================*/
Title bar doubleclick is ignored because there is no title bar. - Should the top
part of the frame be treated as a titlebar?

/*=== Shade ==================================================================*/
At the moment, shade makes no sense for this style.  As a result, the shade
button currently lowers the window. (Why isn't there a
{move,lower,shade,fullscreen} button (maybe I should visit bugs.kde.org)) The
Right Way to shade for this style is to make a shaded window use the dialog
style title bar, but the dialog style title bar is in the TODO list.

/*=== Border Color ===========================================================*/
In this style, the frame, buttons, and title bar are all kind of the same thing
- they don't look right unless they are the same color.  - Use the title bar
colors for the button bar and make the frame a different color.
