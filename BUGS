These are known bugs in Fitz.  Most of them will be fixed eventually. There are
also unknown bugs, which probably won't be fixed until someone like you finds
them and tells me about it or fixes it themselves.

/*=== Scribbling on Other Applications =======================================*/
Fitz assumes that the top-right corner is empty. If an application actually puts
something there, Fitz will cover it up, which will look bad and may hurt
functionality.

applications that use their top-right corner:
gimp - All sorts of stuff (I currently switch decorations to use the gimp)
firefox - the about firefox button
konsole - some programs (including lynx) use that corner of the console if the
		menu is off
old-school X programs that put the help menu on the right side.  It's been
		several years since I've seen one of these.

Dialog titlebars will fix the gimp problem.

/*=== Shade ==================================================================*/
At the moment, shade makes no sense for this style.  As a result, the shade
button currently lowers the window.  The Right Way to shade for this style is
to make a shaded window use the dialog style title bar, but the dialog style
title bar is in the TODO list.

/*=== Border Color ===========================================================*/
In this style, the frame, buttons, and title bar are all kind of the same thing
- they don't look right unless they are the same color.  - Use the title bar
colors for the button bar and make the frame a different color.

/*=== Mouse Stealing ??? =====================================================*/
On two occasions during the past few weeks my mouse suddenly stopped working.
Moving worked, but clicking didn't.  Stoping X and then starting it again did
not fix the problem, so I don't see how Fitz could have don that, but I'm not
completely sure.
