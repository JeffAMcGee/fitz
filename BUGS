These are known bugs in Fitz.  Most of them will be fixed eventually. There are
also unknown bugs, which probably won't be fixed until someone like you finds
them and tells me about it or fixes it themselves. :-)

/*=== Scribbling on Other Applications =======================================*/
Fitz assumes that the top-right corner is empty. If an application actually puts
something there, Fitz will cover it up, which will look bad and may hurt
functionality.

applications that use their top-right corner:
firefox - the about firefox button
konsole - some programs (including lynx) use that corner of the console.  This
	is only a prolbem if the menu is off
old-school X programs that put the help menu on the right side.  It's been
	several years since I've seen one of these on Linux.

/*=== Border Color ===========================================================*/
In this style, the frame, buttons, and title bar are all kind of the same thing
- they don't look right unless they are the same color.  - Use the title bar
colors for the button bar and make the frame a different color.
