These are known bugs in Fitz.  Most of them will be fixed eventually. There are
also unknown bugs, which probably won't be fixed until someone like you finds
them and tells me about it or fixes it themselves. :-)

/*=== Drawing issues =========================================================*/
The bottom 20 pixels may be cut off on dialog windows.  This is because the
toggleDialog() code is still broken.   Also, when you first switch to fitz, it
may draw some applications wrong.  If you move or resize the window that is
messed up, this problem will go away.

/*=== Beryl ==================================================================*/
Fitz does not work with Beryl.  Beryl does not like the window decoration on
top of the window.  This is probably also true for compviz and kwin 4.0.

/*=== Scribbling on Other Applications =======================================*/
Fitz assumes that the top-right corner is empty. If an application actually puts
something there, Fitz will cover it up, which will look bad and may hurt
functionality.

applications that use their top-right corner:
firefox - the about firefox button
konsole - some programs (including lynx) use that corner of the console.  This
	is only a prolbem if the menu is off
old-school X programs that put the help menu on the right side.  It's been
	several years since I've seen one of these on Linux.

/*=== Grabbing the Mouse =====================================================*/
Fitz works poorly with kmag.  I think they both try to grab the mouse.
