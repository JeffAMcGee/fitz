Ftiz is based on an example window manager created by David Johnson.  His
code was under a very liberal license, which only applies to the part of the
program that he wrote.  If you want to copy, modify, or distribute Fitz, you
must comply with both the terms of his license (shown below) _and_ the GNU GPL.
If you would prefer to use just his original code, you can get it at
http://www.usermode.org/code/example-0.5.tar.gz ; if that link is broken, I'd be
glad to send you a copy by email or http.  Just send an email to
